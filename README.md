# Overview

ATT&CK™ View is a planning tool that help defenders in designing an adversary
emulation plans based on MITRE™ ATT&CK™ framework in a structured approach. As a demonstration, ATT&CK™ View comes bundled
with a full adversary emulation plan for **APT3** developed by MITRE™ (SOURCE :
https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Adversary_Emulation_Plans).

# The ATT&CK™ Data Model

There are many use cases for ATT&CK™ framework, many of which depend on existing tools being ATT&CK™-enabled, to make this process easier, the database in this repository can help in getting up to speed with integrating existing tools with ATT&CK™, build your own tooling or fuse ATT&CK™ with other existing frameworks.

The database is based on SQLite for simplicity and portability, however, it is better to think of terms of a data model instead of the underlying technology used in implementation, this is very important, as it enables exploring other useful models and applications and then narrow down to technology.

The following is a conceptual model that can be implemented using any database technology (The *attack_view_db_structure.sql* is a good starting point).

# Accessing ATT&amp;CK™ Data with SQL

To have a better understanding about the database structure, following is  a list of sample SQL queries used to read ATT&amp;CK™. To run the following SQL queries, you will need a SQLite management tool, there are many free and paid tools available supporting Windows, macOS and Linux (https://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=ManagementTools)

*Some output truncated for brevity*

### Get the list of ATT&amp;CK™ techniques

**SQL**

`SELECT name
FROM sdos_object
WHERE type IS "attack-pattern";`

**OUTPUT**

<table>
<tr><th>name</th></tr>
<tr><td>.bash_profile and .bashrc</td></tr>
<tr><td>Access Token Manipulation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Accessibility Features</td></tr>
<tr><td>Account Discovery</td></tr>
<tr><td>Account Manipulation</td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td></tr></table>

### Get the list of ATT&amp;CK™ techniques names with their STIX 2.0 identifier

**SQL**

`SELECT id, name
FROM sdos_object
WHERE type IS "attack-pattern";`

**OUTPUT**

<table>
<tr><th>id</th><th>name</th></tr>
<tr><td>attack-pattern--01df3350-ce05-4bdf-bdf8-0a919a66d4a8</td><td>.bash_profile and .bashrc</td></tr>
<tr><td>attack-pattern--dcaa092b-7de9-4a21-977f-7fcb77e89c48</td><td>Access Token Manipulation</td></tr>

<tr><td>attack-pattern--a10641f4-87b4-45a3-a906-92a149cb2c27</td><td>Account Manipulation</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">...</td></tr>
</table>

*The* **id** *field is a unique key that will be used frequently in many SQL queries*

The external references are stored in external_references table, since one ATT&amp;CK™ technique can have one or more references, the link between the two tables is the technique identifier (check previous query), I will list multiple ways to access the external references

### Get the list of ATT&amp;CK™ techniques with external names

**SQL**

```
SELECT name, external_id
FROM sdos_object INNER JOIN external_references ON 
     sdos_object.id = external_references.fk_object_id
WHERE 
  sdos_object.type IS "attack-pattern"
  AND 
  external_references.source_name IS "mitre-attack";
```

**OUTPUT**

<table>
<tr><th>name</th><th>external_id</th></tr>
<tr><td>.bash_profile and .bashrc</td><td>T1156</td></tr>
<tr><td>Access Token Manipulation</td><td>T1134</td></tr>
<tr><td>Accessibility Features</td><td>T1015</td></tr>
<tr><td>Account Discovery</td><td>T1087</td></tr>
<tr><td>Account Manipulation</td><td>T1098</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">...</td></tr>
</table>

### List all ATT&amp;CK™ techniques associated with "Windows" platform 

**SQL**

```
SELECT name, external_id
FROM sdos_object INNER JOIN external_references ON
     sdos_object.id = external_references.fk_object_id
WHERE 
  sdos_object.type IS "attack-pattern" AND 
  x_mitre_platforms_windows IS "true" AND 
  external_references.source_name IS "mitre-attack";
```

**OUTPUT**

<table>
<tr><th>name</th><th>external_id</th></tr>
<tr><td>Access Token Manipulation</td><td>T1134</td></tr>
<tr><td>Accessibility Features</td><td>T1015</td></tr>

WHERE (type IS "malware" OR type IS "tool") -- Query for tools or malware
  AND id IN (SELECT target_ref -- filter tools/malware associated with APT3

### Get ATOMIC™ test(s) associated with an ATT&CK™ technique

ATOMIC™ Tests are stored in three tables
- atomic_test table, this table simply maps ATOMIC™ tests to ATT&CK™ techniques. Each atomic_test record has one or more atomic_attack_test records that contains the actual test details
- atomic_attack_test, this tables holds the actual ATOMIC™ test details, each test has one or more input arguments represented with an atomic_input_arguments record
- atomic_input_arguments, holds tests input arguments details

The following SQL statement retrieves the ATOMIC™ test(s) associated with ATT&CK™ technique "T1031"

**SQL**

```
SELECT name, description, executor_name, executor_command
FROM atomic_attack_test
  WHERE fk_atomic_attack_id IN 
    (SELECT id FROM atomic_attack 
     WHERE fk_attack_external_id IS "T1031");
```

**OUTPUT**
